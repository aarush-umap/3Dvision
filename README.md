This is a project for exploring different techniques in 3D computer vision. The code involved in this project is for learning the inner-workings of the tools utilized. Each "module" will include a blind attempt and corrections I make along the way for completeness. Hopefully it'll be a lens into my learning process that I can refer back to if necessary :)

Current Topics:
- Homogeneous coordinates
- Projective Transformations
- Image stitching
